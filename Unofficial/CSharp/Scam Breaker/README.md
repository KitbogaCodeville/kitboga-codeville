# Scam Breaker - By [Twitter.com/0x000T](https://www.twitter.com/0x000T)
## Made for scambaiters who wanna waste scammers time trying to type.
### Use on a VM, do not use on your real computer.
#### Requires .NET 4.6.2 - Download [.NET 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344)

This is a simple program, that runs in the background.
It will detect if a notepad is open, and then it will scan for keywords that match.. **Customizable keywords**
You can edit the keywords using **Breaker_config.json**. If it detects a keyword, it will lock the entire notepad.
And change the text inside, title of the notepad window. It takes minimal CPU.

### To be added
+ On exit it will run again.. (If not crashed).
+ GUI for easy config editing.
+ Hooks into Command Prompt (cmd.exe).

For now you'll need to edit the **Breaker_config.json**, which will be generated inside **C:\Windows\Breaker_config.json**
I'm going to make a GUI editor for the easy edit.
EDIT: Someone got salty because i copied 3 lines of code because it helped the performance.
So i give credits goes to whomever helped me.
Oh, and what a certain user wrote is 90% false.
1.) So, to be able to create a program it NEEDS to have another idea. So i can't create a chat program because Discord already exists. No that means i copied every single line of code and copied the idea.
2.) Everyone gets helped by the internet and i mean **everyone**, You don't need to credit them if they wrote a public comment on stack overflow. They don't own that specific line of code. The program WAS made by me, nobody else wrote it for me.
People need to stop thinking about others and worry about themself.
Please, don't lay your hand into business where they don't belong.
This program is not paid, it's open source. I'd appreciate that people stop complaing about "i copied this, and he copied that". I'm not a business, i'm a human person. Doing this as a hobby, i love to code. That's what i do.
I really hope [Kitboga](https://www.twitch.tv/kitboga) uses this for his scambaits.
I'd appreciate some feedback.. [Tweet me](https://www.twitter.com/0x000T)
I hope you enjoy some fun times with this lil' program.
