# Scam Breaker - By [Twitter.com/0x000T](https://www.twitter.com/0x000T)
## Made for scambaiters who wanna waste scammers time trying to type.
### Use on a VM, do not use on your real computer.
#### Requires .NET 6.4.2 - Download [.NET 6.4.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344)

This is a simple program, that runs in the background.
It will detect if a notepad is open, and then it will scan for keywords that match.. **Customizable keywords**
You can edit the keywords using **Breaker_config.json**. If it detects a keyword, it will lock the entire notepad.
And change the text inside, title of the notepad window. It takes minimal CPU.

### To be added
+ On exit it will run again.. (If not crashed).
+ GUI for easy config editing.
+ Hooks into Command Prompt (cmd.exe).

For now you'll need to edit the **Breaker_config.json**, which will be generated inside **C:\Windows\Breaker_config.json**
I'm going to make a GUI editor for the easy edit.
This program is made by me, and me only.
I really hope [Kitboga](https://www.twitch.tv/kitboga) uses this for his scambaits.
I'd appreciate some feedback.. [Tweet me](https://www.twitter.com/0x000T)
I hope you enjoy some fun times with this lil' program.
